Here’s a comprehensive guide:\n\n### 1. **Hardware Checks**\n- **CPU Usage:** Monitor for unusually high usage which could indicate a process issue.\n- **Memory Usage:** Check for sufficient free RAM and any memory leaks.\n- **Disk Usage:** Ensure there is adequate free space and monitor disk health for errors or failures.\n- **Temperature:** Verify that CPU and GPU temperatures are within safe operating ranges to prevent overheating.\n- **Peripheral Functionality:** Test external devices like keyboards, mice, and printers.\n\n### 2. **Software Checks**\n- **Operating System Health:** Look for any OS updates or patches available and ensure security features are activated.\n- **Application Performance:** Monitor installed software for expected performance and crashes.\n- **Error Logs:** Check system and application logs for errors or warning messages that could indicate problems.\n- **Antivirus & Security:** Ensure antivirus definitions are up-to-date and perform a malware scan.\n\n### 3. **Network Checks**\n- **Connectivity:** Ensure that the system is connected to the internet and local network.\n- **Speed Tests:** Conduct speed tests to verify network speeds are as expected.\n- **Ping Tests:** Ping critical servers or websites to check the latency and packet loss.\n- **Firewall:** Review firewall settings for unauthorized changes.\n\n### 4. **User Accounts & Permissions**\n- **Access Control:** Verify user account permissions are set correctly and review recent access logs.\n- **Password Policies:** Ensure password policies are enforced and secure.\n\n### 5. **Backup and Recovery**\n- **Data Backups:** Confirm that backups are recent, complete, and stored securely.\n- **Recovery Plans:** Review recovery plans to ensure they are up-to-date and functional.\n\n### 6. **Performance Metrics**\n- Use monitoring tools to track performance metrics over time to spot trends that could indicate deteriorating health.\n\n### Tools you might use:\n- **Task Manager:** For real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.\n- **Event Viewer:** To look through Windows logs for errors or warnings.\n- **Disk Utility (or fsck on Linux):** To check and repair disks.\n- **S.M.A.R.T. Monitoring Tools:** For advanced disk diagnostics.\n- **Network Utilities:** Such as `ipconfig`, `netstat`, or `traceroute` for network diagnosis.\n- **Third-party Tools:** Like HWMonitor, Speccy, or CrystalDiskInfo for detailed diagnostics.\n\nRegularly performing these checks and audits helps maintain system health and preemptively address issues before they escalate.",
